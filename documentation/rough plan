Input script only gives variable names:
    pathway
    run_soh

    a_lattice
    mass
    timestep
    del_k
    k_steps
    k_steps_accurate
    
Each unit has it's own file.

Units are organised into bricks, which carry out  a larger process.

Bricks are run together in pathway files. Each pathway defines a specific type of run (pathway 1 = static uncompressed; pathway 2 = static uniaxially compressed along 111; pathway 3 = shocked along 111).
Each brick writes it's output to a file. This file is then read as input for the next brick.

Each unit and brick is timed.

Pathway 1:
    startwatch
    calc_md_temperature
    get_fcc_list
    get_peak_intensities
    get_ln_intensity
    get_slope_ln_intensity_vs_gsqr
    calc_xrd_temperature
    stopwatch
    write_log_file
